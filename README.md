## Setup
### Requirements
- Recent version of Node.js installed using the official Windows installer or via [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) on other platforms
- Local PostgreSQL server and permission to create databases
- Latest version of [Docker or Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com) if you decide to use Docker

### Installation
Once you have Node.js properly installed, clone the repository and run `npm install` from the root of the project. This will install all the necessary packages. Now, we will prepare the database.

Create a new PostgreSQL database and make sure you can connect to it with an account that has editing permissions. Then rename `.env.example` to `.env`, modify connection values if you need to, and run the command `npm run resetdb`. Once that completes successfully, run `npm run dev` to launch the server.

### Deploying via Docker
Once Docker or Docker Desktop is installed, clone this repository, rename `.env.example` to `.env`, modify connection values if you need to, and run `docker compose up -d --build` from the root of the project.

Logs can be displayed by using `docker logs -f pamplona-future`. To stop the server and database containers, run `docker compose down`.

### Connecting
Add [catalyst-mitm](https://github.com/ploxxxy/catalyst-mitm) to the installation directory of the game to redirect all traffic to localhost. When launched, the game should connect to your new server.
