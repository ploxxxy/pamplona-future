## Setup
### Requirements
- Recent version of Node.js installed using the official Windows installer or via [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) on other platforms
- Local PostgreSQL server and permission to create databases

### Installation
Once you have Node.js properly installed, clone the repository and run `npm install` from the root of the project. This will install all the necessary packages. Now, we will prepare the database.

Create a new PostgreSQL database and make sure you can connect to it with an account that has editing permissions. Then, create a new file called `.env` in the project root. In this file add a connection string in the following format:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://[username]:[password]@localhost:5432/[database]
```

To test the connection and initialize the database, run the command `npm run resetdb`. Once that completes successfully, run `npm start` to launch the server.

### Connecting
Add [catalyst-mitm](https://github.com/ploxxxy/catalyst-mitm) to the installation directory of the game to redirect all traffic to localhost. When launched, the game should connect to your new server.
